                GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
                It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

            <ul>
                <li>Create and use a repository</li>
                <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
                <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
                <li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Repository">
            <header>

                A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
                Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.
                Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. 
                With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. 
                You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work.

        <section class="main-section" id="Branch">
            <header>
                <h2>Branch</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                By default, your repository has one branch named <code>main</code> that is considered to be the definitive branch. 
                You can create additional branches off of <code>main</code> in your repository. 
                You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. 
                The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Commit">
            <header>
                <h2>Commit</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. 
                On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains. 
                For example, <code>typo</code> or <code>increase rate limit</code>.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Pull_request">
            <header>
                <h2>Pull request</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using GitHub's <code>@mention</code> feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.
            </p>
            <p>Steps to open a pull request</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the Pull requests tab of your repository</li>
                <li>Click New pull request</li>
                <li>Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit</li>
                <li>Click Create pull request</li>
